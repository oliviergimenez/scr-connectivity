# Assessing connectivity with package oSCR

Data and R code to fit a spatial capture-recapture model using ecological distance (vs. euclidian distance). 
We also calculate realized density and connectivity measures such as potential connectivity and density-weighted connectivity. 

Plain R code and code for implementation in R package `oSCR` are provided.
